Online Shop using Express.js
------

> Express.js implementation of a simple online shopping website

## Overview

This is a demo project that I built for demonstrating my skills building Node.js server side backend application.

This project uses Express.js as the framework.

The whole project uses the MVC project structure.

## Usage

download the project and run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

and simply go to `localhost:3000` via your favorite browser (please don\'t use IE), and you should see the whole website. 


## TODO

This project is still work-in-progress and will update daily (I hope).
